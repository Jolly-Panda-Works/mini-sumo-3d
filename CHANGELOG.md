# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Builds from `main` are released automatically as `MAJOR.MINOR.<build number>`; tagged releases (`vX.Y.Z`) use the tag exactly.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Offline practice mode: while no online server is available, every room runs locally in the client with the same GameSession as the server, against bots. Production builds without `VITE_SERVER_URL` start offline; online builds fall back to offline when the server can't be reached. `VITE_NETWORK_MODE` forces `online`, `offline` or `auto`.

### Changed

- Mobile controls: floating joystick that appears under your thumb anywhere on the left side (or a fixed corner stick), a larger dash button with a countdown, vibration on dashes, hits and ring-outs, and controls hide once you are out of the round. New settings: *Joystick* and *Vibration*.

### Fixed

- *Play now* always failed with "That room is full or a match is already running": the room assigned to Colyseus' read-only `locked` property while being created.
- The first-launch name prompt now covers the game with a dark backdrop and nothing else is shown behind it.

### Added

- Bots: the host of a private room can add and remove computer-controlled wrestlers in the lobby.
- Quick match: *Play now* waits up to 30 seconds for other players, then fills the room with bots (ordinary random names, same look as players) and starts automatically.
- First-launch name prompt; the name is saved for next time.
- Character customisation before a match: hair style and colour, face and outfit, with a live 3D preview. The look is saved, sent when joining and synced to everyone; the belt keeps the player colour. Bots get a random look.
